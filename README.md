# Terraforming with Freeman

This repository is part of the "Terraforming with Freeman" livestream on twitch.tv/hashicorplive, where Erik guides Alexandra through starting with Terraform and Infrastructure as Code, from scratch.

## Episode One

In the first episode, Alexandra set up her freshly installed OSX machine with Homebrew, Visual Studio Code, Terraform, zsh + fzf and Docker.
She then set her first steps with Terraform by going through the lifecycle of a resource. She created her first Docker container, made changes and updated it, and finally destroyed it.

## Episode Two

In the second episode, Alexandra took her first steps in the Cloud by creating Google Cloud Storage buckets and managing files inside those buckets.
The episode also highlighted how to set up Terraform Cloud to remotely plan and apply, and store the resulting state.
